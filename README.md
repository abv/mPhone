Running on your mPrinter
-----------------------------

The [mPrinter](http://themprinter.com/) is a small WiFi-enabled thermal printer with an API. To get mPhone running on your mPrinter, login to  [http://manage.themprinter.com/mprints/details/51d77ecdf70787000000005c](http://manage.themprinter.com/mprints/details/51d77ecdf70787000000005c) and follow the directions there.

Once setup, you'll have a custom mPhone telephone number for your mPrinter. You'll be able to print voicemails and text messages when people call or text you.
